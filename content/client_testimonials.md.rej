 Client Review, Juvenile Justice Case: 
      "I was a juvenile entangled in the criminal justice system when I first met Mr. Bondy. I was neither in school nor sure about my future. Mr. Bondy inspired me to pursue an education, despite any perceived hurdles. His guidance and assistance were a critical aspect to my development as a responsible and accountable person. I have the utmost respect for Mr. Bondy. He is a great person, mentor, and friend."
